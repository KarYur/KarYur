- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KarYur

About me:
I am a specialist with higher education, graduated with honors and got a Master's degree in 
Nuclear Physics and Technology at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI.
During my studies I have solved many different logical and mathematical tasks on the base of 
Python 3.9, during which I learned to use PyCharm with confidence and did several small scientific 
projects.
I know the basics of OOP in the Python language, as well as various and basic Python modules like: 
numPy, math, pylab, Pandas, requests, os, sys, etc., for database analysis, graphing and for tasks that 
have no solution.
During the course of training, I learned how to test both my own and others' written code.

About me:
I am Karen Muradyan, the author of several innovative software solutions. One of my programs enables users to upload images in any format and convert them into any other desired format with specific pixel dimensions, as defined by the user. This tool is particularly useful for platforms like Wildberries, where it can help sellers meet the platform's image upload requirements.

Another program I developed features a custom interface that allows users to input specific parameters and instantly calculate and visualize the design of a glass sliding partition. This solution enables users to quickly assess the appearance and cost of their product, streamlining the decision-making process.

Additionally, I have created a program that leverages a Telegram bot to boost product ratings on marketplace platforms, providing a powerful tool for sellers to enhance their visibility and sales.

Currently, I am focusing on software design and conducting in-depth research on creating robust and efficient structures for both desktop and mobile applications.
